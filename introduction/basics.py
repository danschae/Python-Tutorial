This section is more just about very basic programming, i'm not putting too much effort into it. This type of information is universal to most programming languages.

print("hello world") # simple console log

print (5 * 7)

print("hello" + " world") # can concatante strings just like in javascript

# greetings = "Hello"

"""
the good thing with python is that variables can have multiple types implied. It's more that the value has a data type. Python is a strongly typed languaged meaning the data types should match with each other, so you can't concatante a string with a number. Javascript for example is a weakly typed language.
