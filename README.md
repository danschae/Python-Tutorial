# Python Tutorial

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is just to create a detailed python tutorial, the source code will be following a udemy course, [which can be found here](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/). If you're interested in learning it, please support the official course. However, I'll be adding my own notes as I go, so feel free to use it as a reference.
